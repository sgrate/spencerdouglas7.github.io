# Some of my current work (demos not all present)

### Stephen Gould Shipping & Receiving Manager/Calendar (Web application)
  Designed and developed independently in coordination with SGI employees. Created during my time as a Software Engineering Intern at Stephen Gould
  Indianapolis. Currently in use as SGI's primary means of scheduling, tracking, and coordinating all its deliveries & 
  shipments. Provides ability to schedule/track trucks, edit info about current appointments, automatically email employees
  about issues/changes, late shipments, etc. Has been a tremendous success & greatly increased S&R accountability and traceability.

### MIDAS (iOS application)

  Developed in a group of 4 using scrum, Software Engineering practices & design/documentation. Aims to consolidate expense reporting
  & personal finance tracking within a single software solution. Allows users to track, categorize & view personal expense data, as well as create
  events and connect with other users to manage/plan finances for events or groups. Applications include personal finance management, event planning,
  shared expense management (roommates, couples, etc.). Project was a great success despite the many obstacles encountered during production, including
  COVID-19 sending everyone home a mere week after completing our first sprint!
 
 <b>Demo coming soon.</b>
  
### Stephen Gould Rate Tracker (Web application)

  Designed and developed independently in coordination with SGI employees. Currently in early beta testing at SGI. Will be used to track & monitor rate
  production data, audit production over time, and generate reports for all products produced/packed in-house.
  
### Stephen Gould CorruQuote (Web application)

  Designed and developed independently in coordination with SGI employees. Currently in early development & testing. Will be used to generate quotes of
  all in-house products, all of which rely an an inherently nebulous and varied quoting process. Will reduce quoting labor costs substantially.
